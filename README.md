The online web-page of the manuscript "The hidden factor: accounting for covariate effects in power and sample size computation for a binary trait"

## Data

- **Section 4.1-4.2**: simulated datasets are generated in the R scripts.

- **Section 5**: datasets are obtained from UK Biobank.

## Scripts

The simulation/examples in the main paper are replicated in the following scripts. Specific points to pay attention to:
1. In each simulation/example, please make sure the working directory is correctly specified.
2. All the required R packages will be loaded in the R script, please make sure they are installed in the system before proceed.


The results in the paper are reproduced as follows:

- **Section 4.1-4.2**:  
     - *script.R* generates the dataset and runs the simulation. It will also produce the figures used in the manuscript, and save them in the current working directory.
